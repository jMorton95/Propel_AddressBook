# Propel_AddressBook
Address Book Application for Propel Tech's Technical Assessment:  
  
Stack: HTML5, SCSS, JS ES6 (Babel), WebPackJS 
  
Day 1 26/07:  
Built a simple single page front-end app that imports an Array of Objects from a .JSON Flat File and creates an Address Book Card for each index and a functional form that can store a new implementation of an Address Object with an ES6 Class and render new cards.    

With a background entirely in Vanilla Front-End builds to date, this has been a challenge right to configure right from the start.

<-- Key Learning Points:  -->  
This has pushed me to learn new JS techniques, such as:  

-- An extensible DOM Element producing Function that takes a tag type, class, text content and any number of children Elements to append and returns a new DOM     Object.
-- Creating an Array from all Values in a NodeList through .map() and immediately assigning the results to a Class Instantiation  
-- I've really grasped function parameters and how powerful they can be in the right context on a much deeper level than I have in prior study. Passing a specific object index deep into a function tree and how powerful custom parameters in certain instances can be.  

Considerations for next day:  
I currently have no knowledge or experience in API or Backend Development, so I'll first find a way to modify my flat JSON file to mimic a soft Database before diving deep into API to see if I can find an implementation in-time for submitting this assessment!
